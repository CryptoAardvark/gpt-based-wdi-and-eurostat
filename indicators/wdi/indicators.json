The resulting aggregate represents, therefore, disposable production for any use except as seed and feed.  All the indices at the country, regional and world levels are calculated by the Laspeyres formula. Production quantities of each commodity are weighted by 2004-2006 average international commodity prices and summed for each year.  To obtain the index, the aggregate for a given year is divided by the average aggregate for the base period 2004-2006.  Since the FAO indices are based on the concept of agriculture as a single enterprise, amounts of seed and feed are subtracted from the production data to avoid double counting them, once in the production data and once with the crops or livestock produced from them.  Deductions for seed (in the case of eggs, for hatching) and for livestock and poultry feed apply to both domestically produced and imported commodities.  They cover only primary agricultural products destined to animal feed (e.g. maize, potatoes, milk, etc.). Processed and semi-processed feed items such as bran, oilcakes, meals and molasses have been completely excluded from the calculations at all stages.   should be noted that when calculating indices of agricultural, food and nonfood production, all intermediate primary inputs of agricultural origin are deducted. However, for indices of any other commodity group, only inputs originating from within the same group are deducted; thus, only seed is removed from the group \u201ccrops\u201d and from all crop subgroups, such as cereals, oil crops, etc.; and both feed and seed originating from within the livestock sector (e.g. milk feed, hatching eggs) are removed from the group \u201clivestock products\u201d. For the main two livestock subgroups, namely, meat and milk, only feed originating from the respective subgroup is removed.  The  \u201dinternational commodity prices\u201d are used in order to avoid the use of exchange rates for obtaining continental and world aggregates, and also to improve and facilitate international comparative analysis of productivity at the national level.

        "description": "Change in income (%) for bottom 40% of the population by impact, by 2030, from climate change impacts relating to Temperature, is generated from data within Shock Waves : Managing the Impacts of Climate Change on Poverty. This report examines the potential impact of climate change and climate policies on poverty reduction. It also provides guidance on how to create a \u201cwin-win\u201d situation so that climate change policies contribute to poverty reduction and poverty-reduction policies contribute to climate change mitigation and resilience building. The key finding of the report is that climate change represents a significant obstacle to the sustained eradication of poverty, but future impacts on poverty are determined by policy choices: rapid, inclusive, and climate-informed development can prevent most short-term impacts whereas immediate pro-poor, emissions-reduction policies can drastically limit long-term ones.",

        "description": "Children under 5 years of age who are stunted reflects modelled estimate from the Suite of Food Security Indicators on FAOSTAT. Suite of Food Security Indicators presents the core set of food security indicators. Following the recommendation of experts gathered in the Committee on World Food Security (CFS) Round Table on hunger measurement, hosted at FAO headquarters in September 2011, an initial set of indicators aiming to capture various aspects of food insecurity is presented on FAOSTAT. The choice of the indicators has been informed by expert judgment and the availability of data with sufficient coverage to enable comparisons across regions and over time. Many of these indicators are produced and published elsewhere by FAO and other international organizations. They are reported on FAOSTAT in a single database with the aim of building a wide food security information system. More indicators will be added to this set as more data will become available. Indicators are classified along the four dimensions of food security -- availability, access, utilization and stability.

Heavily indebted poor countries reach HIPC completion point if they maintain macroeconomic stability under a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) supported program, carry out key structural and social reforms agreed on at the decision point, and implement satisfactorily Poverty Reduction Strategy for one year. Debt relief is then provided irrevocably by the country\u2019s creditors.",

Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to be recorded as ODA.

        "description": "The debt service to export ratio is defined as the total debt service divided by the sum of exports of goods, services, and income plus workers' remittances.  Definitions for each indicator follow.  Total debt service (TDS) shows the debt service payments on total long-term debt (public and publicly guaranteed and private nonguaranteed), use of IMF credit, and interest on short-term debt only. Debt service payments are the sum of principal repayments and interest payments in the year specified.  Exports of goods, services and income is the sum of goods (merchandise) exports, exports of (nonfactor) services and income (factor) receipts.  Data are in current U.S. dollars.  Workers' remittances are current transfers by migrants who are employed or intend to remain employed for more than a year in another economy in which they are considered residents. Some developing countries classify workers' remittances as a factor income receipt (and thus as a component of GNI). The World Bank adheres to international guidelines in defining GNI, and its classification of workers' remittances may therefore differ from national practices. This item shows receipts by the reporting country. ",

The grant equivalent of a loan is its commitment (present) value, less the discounted present value of its contractual debt service; conventionally, future service payments are discounted at 5 percent. Debt service payments are the sum of principal repayments and interest payments actually made in the year specified. Data are in current U.S. dollars.",

A drought is an extended period of time characterized by a deficiency in a region's water supply that is the result of constantly below average precipitation. A drought can lead to losses to agriculture, affect inland navigation and hydropower plants, and cause a lack of drinking water and famine. A flood is a significant rise of water level in a stream, lake, reservoir or coastal region. Extreme temperature events are either cold waves or heat waves. A cold wave can be both a prolonged period of excessively cold weather and the sudden invasion of very cold air over a large area. Along with frost it can cause damage to agriculture, infrastructure, and property. A heat wave is a prolonged period of excessively hot and sometimes also humid weather relative to normal climate patterns of a certain region. Population affected is the number of people injured, left homeless or requiring immediate assistance during a period of emergency resulting from a natural disaster; it can also include displaced or evacuated people. Average percentage of population affected is calculated by dividing the sum of total affected for the period stated by the sum of the annual population figures for the period stated.",

The target population was the non institutionalized population, aged 16-24 years, residing in the country at the time of data collection, irrespective of nationality, citizenship or language status. Literacy-related non-respondents are not included in the calculation of the mean scores which, thus, present an upper bound of the estimated literacy proficiency of the population.

Mean per capita real consumption or income is measured at 2017 Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) using the Poverty and Inequality Platform (http://www.pip.worldbank.org). For some countries means are not reported due to grouped and/or confidential data. The annualized growth rate is computed as (Mean in final year/Mean in initial year)^(1/(Final year - Initial year)) - 1.  The reference year is the year in which the underlying household survey data was collected. In cases for which the data collection period bridged two calendar years, the first year in which data were collected is reported. The initial year refers to the nearest survey collected 5 years before the most recent survey available, only surveys collected between 3 and 7 years before the most recent survey are considered. \n\nThe coverage and quality of the 2017 PPP price data for Iraq and most other North African and Middle Eastern countries were hindered by the exceptional period of instability they faced at the time of the 2017 exercise of the International Comparison Program.

The overall 12 GATS commitment index is a simple average of the sectoral indices.

For the purpose of calculating this indicator, Japan in Asia, Canada and the United States in North America, Australia and New Zealand in Oceania and Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and the EU (25 countries included since 2004) in Europe are considered \u201cdeveloped\u201d regions or areas, following the common accepted practice used for MDG indicators. Developing countries are those not listed as developed or transition countries. The list of least developed countries (LDCs) has been agreed by the General Assembly, on the recommendation of the Committee for Development Policy, Economic and Social Council. Agricultural, clothing and textile groups follow the definition in WTO agreements based on the Harmonized System 1992, transposed to current versions by WTO Secretariat. Agricultural products correspond to Harmonized System 1992, chapters 01 to 24 less fish and fish products (chap. 03); in addition to parts of chapters 29, 33, 35, 38, 41, 43, 50 to 53.

The figure is calculated as the percentage of people in a given population who have responded \u2018yes\u2019 to a selected number of variables e.g. the use of ICT skills in various subject areas or learning domains, the use of ICT skills inside or outside of school and/or workplace, the minimum amount of time spent using ICT skills inside and outside of school and/or workplace, availability of internet access inside or outside of school and/or workplace, etc. in the past 3 months, regardless of where that activity took place. The data are self-reported information on the use of ICT skills in household surveys. One of the main challenges of measurement for this indicator is that it is based only on the information people self-report. They provide information on the types of activities they have undertaken but not on their proficiency level. While self-reporting offers a cost efficient approach to data collection, it is important to consider that the results can vary between groups from different cultural and personal backgrounds. Women, for example, tend to under-report their abilities in using computers and the Internet, while men tend to overstate them.

These data may be used to inform targeted policies to improve ICT skills, and thus contribute to an inclusive information society. The data compiler for this indicator is the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). Eurostat collects data annually for 32 European countries, while the ITU is responsible for setting up the standards and collecting this information from the remaining countries. The figure is calculated as the percentage of people in a given population who have responded \u2018yes\u2019 to a selected number of variables e.g. the use of ICT skills in various subject areas or learning domains, the use of ICT skills inside or outside of school and/or workplace, the minimum amount of time spent using ICT skills inside and outside of school and/or workplace, availability of internet access inside or outside of school and/or workplace, etc. in the past 3 months, regardless of where that activity took place. The data are self-reported information on the use of ICT skills in household surveys. One of the main challenges of measurement for this indicator is that it is based only on the information people self-report. They provide information on the types of activities they have undertaken but not on their proficiency level. While self-reporting offers a cost efficient approach to data collection, it is important to consider that the results can vary between groups from different cultural and personal backgrounds.

The indicator focuses on attacks carried out for political, military, ideological, sectarian, ethnic or religious reasons by armed forces or nonstate armed groups. The indicator is a broad measure of the safety of learning environments, particularly in relation to armed conflict and political violence. Available data for global tracking are presently collected from reporting by a wide variety of stakeholders, including national and international NGOs working at the country-level and national and international media reports. Attacks on education include the following sub-categories: \u2022 Attacks on schools: targeted violent attacks on preschool, kindergarten, primary, and secondary school buildings or infrastructure by state military forces or non-state armed groups in the form of arson; suicide, car, or other bombs aimed at a school; or artillery fire directed at a school. In addition, this category includes indiscriminate attacks that result in the damage or destruction of school infrastructure as well as explosions that occur in close proximity to a school. \u2022 Attacks on students, teachers, and other education personnel: killings, injuries, torture, abductions, forced disappearances, or threats of violence, including coercion or extortion involving violent threats directed towards students and education staff who work at the primary and secondary levels. Since it is sometimes difficult to identify why a teacher or school staff member is killed if the assassination occurs outside of school, this category also includes such attacks in cases where there is an established pattern of that kind of violence. The category of attacks on students, teachers, and other education personnel also includes cases where police or state security forces violently repress student protests that either occur at school, or, if they occur off-campus, focus on education-related policies and laws. \u2022 Military use of schools and universities: cases in which armed forces or non-state armed groups take over schools or universities as bases, barracks and temporary shelters to house soldiers or fighters, fighting positions, weapons storage facilities, detention and interrogation centres, or for other military purposes. \u2022 Recruitment of children at schools or along school routes: cases in which armed forces or nonstate armed groups use schools or school routes as locales for recruiting children under the age of 18 into their fighting forces in violation of international standards. \u2022 Sexual violence by parties to the conflict: incidents of sexual abuse and harassment perpetrated at schools or universities or along school routes. \u2022 Attacks on higher education: include targeted violent attacks on universities in the form of bombings, airstrikes, arson, or other means, as well as targeted killings, abductions, or threats directed at university students, faculty, or staff. The category includes cases of violent repression of student protests that either occur at institutions of higher education, or, if they occur off-campus, focus on education-related policies and laws. This indicator is based on data compiled by the Global Coalition to Protect Education from Attack (GCPEA) for its report Education under Attack. Information from three types of data sources: reports released by UN agencies, development and humanitarian NGOs, human rights organizations, government bodies, and think tanks; media reports; and information shared with GCPEA by staff members of international and national organizations working in the countries profiled in this study.

The HDI is the geometric mean of the three dimension indices and embodies imperfect substitutability across all HDI dimensions.

Some substitutability is inherent in the definition of any index that increases with the values of its components.

Note: The POLITY score was added to the Polity IV data series in recognition of its common usage by users in quantitative research and in the overriding interest of maintaining uniformity among users in this application. The simple combination of the original DEMOC and AUTOC index values in a unitary POLITY scale, in many ways, runs contrary to the original theory stated by Eckstein and Gurr in Patterns of Authority Polity IV Project: Dataset Users\u2019 Manual 17 (1975) and, so, should be treated and interpreted with due caution. Its primary utility is in investigative research which should be augmented by more detailed analysis. The original theory posits that autocratic and democratic authority are distinct patterns of authority, elements of which may co-exist in any particular regime context. The inclusion of this variable in the data series should not be seen as an acceptance of the counter-proposal that autocracy and democracy are alternatives or opposites in a unified authority spectrum, even though elements of this perspective may be implied in the original theory. The POLITY variable provides a convenient avenue for examining general regime effects in analyses but researchers should note that the middle of the implied POLITY \u201cspectrum\u201d is somewhat muddled in terms of the original theory, masking various combinations of DEMOC and AUTOC scores with the same POLITY score.
